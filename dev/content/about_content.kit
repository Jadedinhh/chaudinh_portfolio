          About me.
        </h1>
        <p>
            Hi :) My name is Jade. I was born and raised in Hanoi, Vietnam, and came to the US when I was 16 all by myself. Iâ€™m pursuing a graphic design degree at Westphal College of Media Arts and Design. 
            Brought up by strict parents, I fought tirelessly with them to pursue my passion for the arts. Alongside my fascination for design and media arts, I have taken an interest in tattooing, especially hand-poked tattoos. With my works, I hope to challenge the view on tattoos as a young asian artist.
